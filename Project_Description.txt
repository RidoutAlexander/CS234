Project Description:

One of my favorite hobbies is playing Poker. For most people, Poker is just a pass time,
however, some people make their living doing it. In order to make your living doing it, you have to
ensure that you are playing in games where you have an advantage over the competition and that you keep
a proper bankroll. In order to be sure that you are doing this, you have to keep track of stats like 
Return on investment (ROI), Variance, Sample size, Bankroll, Winrate, Different types of games, 
and expenses. As a result, most good poker players have a rather messy, difficult to use excel
spreadsheet on their computers. I am going to design a database program that makes this process a lot
easier and more convenient.

The program will allow players to keep track of their winnings in different games. The different types
of games are "Cash Games", "Tournaments", and "Sit-and-go's". These will be different classes.
Tournaments and Sit-and-go's are very similar so Sit-and-Go's will inherit traits from Tournaments.
I will also have a class type for a Session so that my database can pull from a list of sessions.

Some of the methods that I will use include but are not limited to:

SelectGameType()         //returns the type of game
GetBankroll()            //displays the current bankroll
GetRecommendedBuyin()    //displays the recommended buyin
GetFullStats()           //diplays a full stat report for a given game type
CreateSession()          //logs a new session into the database
DeleteSession()          //Removes a session from the database
GetRecommendedGameType() //displays the recommended game to play based off of stats
ValidateSampleSize()     //Answers the question "Is this sample size relevant?" 
                         //Potentially will display a confidence interval
